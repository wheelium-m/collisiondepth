This is a triangle that represents a simple robot arm that is rotating counterclockwise about the z-axis.

Although it isn't rendered, there is a 1x1 box that is located at z = -.5. Whenever the triangle intersects the box, the pixels that go beyond the box are marked as red.

makeFloats.cpp makes the depth texture that is used. Oddly enough, if OpenGL is given a depth texture that has negative floating point values in it, it will change all negative values to be positive.
