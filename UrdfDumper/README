A standalone program that extracts robot geometry from a URDF file.

This program depends on ROS and its standard library's URDF parsing
functionality.

The output format is an ordered list of "links" (i.e. body segments of
the robot) followed by a list of parent-child relationships.

Syntax:
NumLinks
LinkName: (tx, ty, tz) (roll, pitch, yaw) (axis_x, axis_y, axis_z)
ParentIndex -> ChildIndex

Example:
2
base_link: (0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,0,0)
right_leg: (0.22, 0, 0.25) (0,0,0) (1,0,0)
0 -> 1

Notes: The first line, "2," is the number of links in the model. The
next two lines define two named links, each with a translational and
rotational offset from its parent. The last line encodes the tree
structure of the robot by indicating that link 0 is the parent of link
1, where 0 refers to "base_link" and 1 refers to "right_leg".
